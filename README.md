# Autonomous-Car
Create an autonomous car based on Arduino and the subsumption architecture

## Interface
1. Move the sticker rightside left and right to control the direction of the car, and forward and backward to control the left and right turning of the ultrasonic module.  
2. Move the sticker leftside forward and backward to control the speed of the car going forward and backward.
3. Spin the R1 potentiometer to control the startup speed of the DC motor. 
4. Spin the R6 potentiometer to fine tune the direction of the car. 
5. Press Button A to switch the LED colors and status on the car, between white, red, green, blue and off. Press and hold it and the switchingï¼›
6. Press Button B and the car will switch to the remote control mode. At the same time, the LED2 will light up and LED3 go out accordingly, indicating the car now is controlled by the remote control. 
7. Press Button C and the car will switch to the auto-control mode. At the same time, the LED3 will light up and LED2 go out, indicating the car now moves automatically. 
8. Press Button D and the buzzer will beep. As long as you keep pressing, it will keep the beeping. The function is still active under the auto-control mode. 
9. The car enters the remote control mode automatically after power on. 
10. You can switch the status of the car by the remote control.
